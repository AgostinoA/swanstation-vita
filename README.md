# SwanStation for PSVTA - PlayStation 1, aka. PSX Emulator

SwanStation is an open-source Libretro core implementation of DuckStation, which is an emulator of the Sony PlayStation(TM) console, focusing on playability, speed, and long-term maintainability. The goal is to be as accurate as possible while maintaining performance suitable for low-end devices. "Hack" options are discouraged, the default configuration should support all playable games with only some of the enhancements having compatibility issues.

## Tests
 - Passes amidog's CPU and GTE tests in both interpreter and recompiler modes, partial passing of CPX tests
